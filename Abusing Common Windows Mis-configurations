Abusing Common Windows Mis-configurations (Hack The Box — Active)

Active is a machine challenge from HackTheBox.com
Introduction

Another blast from the past! This box is several years old but I decided to revisit a few windows boxes in preparation for the OSCP exam. This challenge covers some of the basic essentials of windows enumeration using rpc, smb, DNS and Active Directory.

Techniques and Vulnerabilities covered:

    Anonymous access to Windows shares
    Exploitation of Group Policy Preferences
    Kerberoasting

Reconnaissance

As with any machine released on HTB, we generally start out with an nmap scan. This time, we are presented with a huge potential attack surface.

One of the big challenges when presented with so many options is where to begin. But, we do learn that there’s an LDAP response indicating a domain called active.htb. Let’s use this and begin to enumerate the DNS service
DNS Enumeration

We point dnsrecon at the active service on port 53. This tool will attempt to perform a zone transfer, which, if successful, will disclose all of the DNS entries in the database.

It turns out this DNS service is configured to block zone transfer attacks. Let’s continue to enumerate.
SMB Enumeration

Enum4linux is a great tool for automating the enumeration of windows machines, I like to run it in verbose mode so I can see more details on the types of queries it is running.

enum4linux -v active.htb

</snip>

I’ve included the tastiest bits from the output of enum4linux above… there are two interesting network shares on this machine: Replication and Users

We also learn that we can map to Replication with a null user and password using the following command

smbclient -W 'WORKGROUP' //'active.htb'/'Replication' -U''%''

We can either browse around the folders via smbclient or download the entire structure with smbget.

Inside this Replication file, we land on a file called Groups.xml that contains a username svc_tgs and a value called cpassword, which appears to be an encrypted password for this user.

A little googling on this reminds us that cpassword is an AES-Encrypted password, but that Microsoft accidentally published the encryption key used, so we can reverse this without much difficulty using gpp-decrypt

GPPstillStandingStrong2k18

Now that we have a username and password, we are able to use that to connect to the Users share

smbclient -W 'WORKGROUP' //'active.htb'/'Users' -U'svc_tgs'%'GPPstillStandingStrong2k18'

The user flag is located in /Users/SVC_TGS/Desktop
Privilege Escalation

This is pretty straight-forward, but for the purposes of enumeration you can use bloodhound to map out the domain and then use the built-in queries to list users who are “kerberoastable”.

bloodhound-python -d active.htb -ns 10.129.178.216 -c All -u svc_tgs -p GPPstillStandingStrong2k18

In this case, Administrator cooks up nicely and can be served with a fresh side-salad! These tools are available from impacket, which can be installed via git

Conclusions

This machine is an excellent introduction to the core concepts involved in pentesting Windows domains and networks. Even though it was launched several years ago, it still remains a popular challenge within the HTB community and is recommended for those seeking to get their OSCP. The challenge feels more real-world and less of the contrived easter-egg hunts that sometimes makes other challenges frustrating.
